# LibreVFD
LibreVFD is a free and open hardware implementation of a programmable variable frequency drive to drive 380-400V
This implementation uses STM32F4 (411/401) for svPWM to achieve smooth three-phase motor control.

Goal of LibreVFD is to provide an open, affordable, replicable programmable VFD implementation that uses general-purpse off-the-shelf components.

## Roadmap
- Testing svPWM signal
- Design PCB
- Design casing and cooling
- Investigate PowerMOSFET vs IGBT performance
